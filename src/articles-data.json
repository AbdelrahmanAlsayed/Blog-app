The new year is not just about the year ending, it is like a goodbye to your old self, the mistakes you made, and the battles you lost all the while hoping for a fresh start with a new year. If you too are looking to rise above the odds and be in the top percentile — you’ve come to the right place. I’m here not to share the wisdom but only my experience. Why must you listen to me? Maybe because I was able to defy the odds and achieve that pedestal for myself this year. In 2023, I was working a 4 figure job that was nothing but a wave of unhappiness."

Are you too comfortable with your work right now? Challenge it — take more tasks and push your boundaries.Want to start your business but don’t have time? Make it. Do work while traveling, cooking, an hour before bed — replace your TV time with work time. Let go of the materialistic happiness. But that’s like being a robot Absolutely not. Like I said, to be ahead of people, you’ll have to do what they’re unwilling to. People in their 20s would party, spend money and buy expensive things, go out each day — there is nothing wrong with that. It is called the life of choice. Your choices today will decide the future you have tomorrow. I like many others, choose to make sacrifices today so that I can have a more comfortable tomorrow. The hustle is not for the weak-hearted — you have to make up your mindset for it. This cultivates resilience, adaptability, and a fearless attitude toward challenges."

Watch a show, eat something healthy, read a book — create a lifestyle that leads to ultimate betterment. Whether you prefer podcasts over reading or yoga over exercise, don’t squander your energy on activities that don’t align with your authentic self. Life is too short to engage in things that fail to ignite your excitement. Navigate away from energy-draining influences like social media or celebrity gossip, and invest your time where it truly matters."

From that day on, I studied like an owl to get the perfect score only to hear those words of affirmation from my parent. That did more harm than good — because when I don’t hear those words, I won’t be proud of my score. I started setting up validation expectations only to feel proud about my work.To surge ahead, abandon the incessant need for approval. So if people congratulate you, feel happy; if they don’t — move ahead.Forge a path guided by internal validation, accepting yourself — including flaws — and pursuing your goals unapologetically."

You’ll have to be comfortable with the idea of failing. For me, whenever I faced a setback, instead of saying ‘I lost’, I just said ‘The experiment didn’t work’. The strongest person is not the one who never lost, but the one who lost but still got back up. In your journey, there are going to be days when you don’t feel motivated, those are the days when you have to push through and come forth stronger.By developing resilience, you not only weather challenges but thrive in the midst of them.."

One day my classmate said “Your templates are so good, I would pay you for them” Ofc, he was joking but that one sentence I’ll never forget. That was the day I took my Notion board and published it for free — within the first day I had 7 downloads. You have to focus on your skills and the things that make you happy.Here is the perfect representation of what can help you make passive income.

I live a pretty thrifty, minimalist lifestyle. When I give someone a gift, it’s usually a heartfelt handmade item of use. I knitted my son a hat, and crocheted a purse for the gift exchange.

Not all of us who are alone for the holidays want the invitation or the sympathy or the martyrdom. Some of us cherish the respite a day alone brings. Don’t decorate their desk, don’t buy them gifts.

In the past, when I read all over the internet, and heard people say every now and then: “Find something you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life.” Let me tell you, even though there have been months in which I wasn’t feeling like writing or felt doubt regarding my overall abilities for creating articles which could add value to people, I worked through them and here I am: publishing once again! Let’s get down today’s topics, shall we?"

                    "content": "In the tapestry of our lives, every step we take today, every effort we muster, and every negative thought we cast aside, lays the foundation for the radiant success that tomorrow promises. Drawing from my own neurodivergent journey, I've navigated the highs and lows, but above all, I've chosen to seize control of the reins. I reject the notion that anyone other than myself is responsible for crafting the magnificence of my journey. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but a necessary truth. Amidst life's challenges, blaming others or shedding tears only provides temporary relief. Instead, I urge you to own your circumstances and find your unique workaround – believe me, you can solve this puzzle. The key? Decide to change, to take matters into your own hands. Reflect on the company you keep, for we are profoundly influenced by those we surround ourselves with. Negativity breeds negativity, and the choice to distance myself from such influences has been liberating. I made a deliberate choice to eliminate those who only spread negativity, fostering a space where criticism has no place. The result? A social circle that celebrates achievements and fuels positivity. Taking this proactive step not only expanded my horizons but also silenced the guilt that often accompanies such decisions. In sharing this, I don't dwell on the past but hope my experiences resonate. This is a journey of self-discovery and empowerment, a testament to the transformative power of surrounding oneself with positivity and taking charge of one's narrative."

To alleviate the self-doubt tied to language proficiency, I devised an activity involving pre-cut papers, pens, and a timer. Participants, guided by a volunteer, decide collectively on the time allocation—fostering a group dynamic. In a supportive environment, each person writes down a wild dream within a time frame, promoting inclusivity. The crucial decision then rests with the group: share individually, in pairs, or in threes. This activity subtly shifts the focus from language apprehension to the excitement of sharing personal aspirations, making the challenge of speaking in English more manageable. The transformative power lies in the shift from linguistic concerns to the willingness to express oneself, revealing the remarkable impact of creating a safe space for open communication."

With a newfound appreciation for our time, I propose a simple yet impactful daily activity. Equip yourself with a paperback notebook or your laptop, maybe a pen, and a timer. Allocate just 15 minutes each day to learn English—a modest starting point but a crucial one. Why 15 minutes? It's about cultivating a sustainable habit, avoiding the pitfalls of unrealistic commitments. Consider the scenario of attempting a daunting hour or two of practice; life's demands can easily disrupt such plans, leading to guilt and negativity. Contrastingly, devoting a manageable 15 minutes daily builds a consistent routine. Picture arriving home, hydrating, and dedicating a focused 15 minutes to English practice. This incremental approach ensures steady progress, transforming language learning into an achievable and rewarding habit."

Brain is not bored. It’s ACTIVE. you finish watching something at a cliffhanger, aargh! Then later you get on youtube or one of these apps. Brain is ACTIVE.

A diverse network brings a wealth of perspectives and opens doors to unforeseen possibilities.\n\n3. Online and Offline Networking:\n\nEmbrace both online and offline networking. Attend industry events, conferences, and local meetups. Simultaneously, leverage online platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and industry forums to expand your virtual presence and connections.\n\n4. Leveraging Social Media:\n\nSocial media is a solopreneur’s ally. Use platforms strategically to showcase your expertise, engage with industry discussions, and connect with like-minded professionals. LinkedIn, in particular, is a goldmine for professional networking.\n\n5. Providing Value in Networking:\n\nNetworking is a two-way street. Provide value to your connections by sharing insights, resources, and support. Actively contribute to discussions and be a valuable asset in your network.\n\n6. The Elevator Pitch:\n\nCraft a compelling elevator pitch that succinctly introduces you and your business. A clear and engaging pitch makes lasting impressions during networking events and interactions.\n\n7. Building Genuine Relationships:\n\nAuthenticity is key.

These gatherings provide a fertile ground for meaningful connections, knowledge exchange, and potential collaborations.\n\n9.

Engage in discussions, share your expertise, and connect with fellow professionals who share similar interests.\n\n11. Collaborative Projects:\n\nExplore collaborative projects with your network. Working on joint ventures, partnerships, or collaborative initiatives can amplify your reach and bring fresh perspectives to your solopreneurial venture.\n\n12. Mentoring and Being Mentored:\n\nBe open to both mentoring and being mentored. Networking often leads to valuable mentorship opportunities. Simultaneously, consider mentoring others based on your experiences and expertise.\n\n13. Overcoming Networking Challenges:\n\nNetworking isn’t without challenges. Overcome common hurdles like shyness or fear of rejection by focusing on the value you bring and approaching interactions with a genuine interest in others.\n\n14. Cultivating a Referral Network:\n\nEncourage and nurture a referral network. Satisfied clients, collaborators, or fellow solopreneurs can become powerful advocates, referring business your way.\n\n15. The Long-Term Impact:\n\nThe true power of networking lies in its long-term impact. Cultivating a strong network doesn’t yield immediate results, but over time, the connections you build can be a source of ongoing support, collaboration, and growth."

And here’s the cool part: dark mode doesn’t just mean a pitch-black background. You can play around with different dark colors to create awesome gradients, highlights, and glows, making your website really pop. These dark mode websites are here to stay and I don’t see this trend fading away anytime soon."

In many ways, it feels like we’re just scratching the surface of what can be done with Bento grids and we can expect to see some cool examples in the coming year.However, like anything, there are pros and cons. The major downside is that it can get a bit overwhelming and messy if not used carefully — like a cluttered desk. So, it’s crucial to use this approach sparingly and not overload the user with too much."

These lively gradients serve as a great background for your website, adding depth without overshadowing the text. The best part is, there are plenty of free websites that can help you customize and create your own gradients. You can do this in almost any design or development tool so if you haven’t tried it yet, I highly recommend diving in and learning how to create polished gradients for a sleek look."

You can pretty much create any image you want and it’s often free. Need a pic of a blue dog in a Santa hat? No problem, you got it. So, it’s crucial for us designers to get the hang of these AI tools. Platforms like Adobe Firefly and Mid Journey are excellent places to start."

While this isn’t exactly new and has been around for a few years. I’m noticing a lot more websites embracing the idea of using really big text. It’s a bit unconventional, challenging the typical way people are used to seeing websites. Personally though I’m a big fan of this trend. Why? Because it makes us, as designers and developers be careful about what text we put on the website. When all your typography is huge, you can’t have tons of content, so each word needs to count. I like this because it’s easy for users to read and understand exactly what the website or company is about. The other reason I love this massive typography trend is that it takes up so much space that you don’t need to rely as much on visuals. You can use fewer images, animations or videos and put more emphasis on the text. Of course, having a unique custom font makes this approach even more effective."

While Facebook is undeniably popular, with over 300 million photos uploaded daily, the reality is stark—business profile posts have a mere 1% organic reach. Simply put, a sporadic post won't lead to business success.\n\nLikes and followers are not a currency unless backed by a robust strategy. Crafting a social media marketing strategy isn't about starting with a post; it begins with understanding your customer's persona. Delve into their social platform preferences, interests, and concerns. Ask crucial questions: Who are the users on each platform? How does your product align with them? Do you need to be present on all platforms? Are your posts research-backed or impromptu?\n\nRecognize that different platforms demand different content. Armed with this knowledge, construct a comprehensive strategy and distribute efforts effectively. Choose appropriate content forms for each platform, avoiding the pitfall of recycling content without adaptation. Remember, if your marketing guru engages in such practices, it might be time for a change. Imagine posting a Facebook update on Medium—ridiculous, isn't it? The key takeaway: social media success hinges on a thoughtful strategy, not just sporadic posts."

To illustrate this point, consider an AI example: generating a picture of a person using Fotor. Yes, you have an image, but who is this person? What are their thoughts, values, beliefs, and desires? Your brand is akin to this person—it's more than just a logo.\n\nThis analogy emphasizes that a brand extends far beyond a visual symbol. Just as the person generated by AI doesn't exist beyond the picture, your brand doesn't exist solely in its logo. I won't delve into a full branding lesson here, but the takeaway is clear: when offered a logo, ensure that there's a commitment to crafting a comprehensive brand identity. A logo alone is not the essence of your brand; it's a nuanced combination of values, beliefs, and experiences that truly define it."

Blah blah. We all know it. And yet, why do so few companies do something about it? You can always show customers that you care about them and their experience. Even if you don’t have the budget. Just be polite by checking on them after the sale. See if everything is fine. Don’t wait for negative reviews. If you follow that advice, you may even resolve issues that no one expected you to resolve. Read: Loyalty boost. And if you are a big company with deep pockets, you have no excuse. You need to invest in retention marketing. The bigger the purchase, the more invested your customers are. Therefore they will need more reassurance that the choice was right. You need to be there and assure them your product/service was indeed the best fit. Not nice to have, but a must-have."

So even if you are a night owl, please ensure that you are not sleep-deprived because ultimately it will end up destroying your productivity. More importantly, we all know the outcomes of sleep deprivation. Waking up in the morning feeling refreshed and ready to start the day gives you enough motivation to bring change in your life and create other important habits. And if you think about it, this is definitely the easiest habit to follow, but has the biggest impact on your life. Here are some small steps to ensure you’re getting up and sleeping on time:- 1.Avoid screens at least 45–60 minutes before bed. 2.Less light exposure at night, and sleep with the blinds open so that it’s easier to wake up in the morning. (Sun exposure works wonders). 3.If you can’t wake up in the morning, keep your phone across the room or in another one. You’ll have to get up to turn it off, and this will also prevent you from staying on your phone late at night.\n"

Exercising is a habit that requires you to show up every day, be consistent, and be disciplined to even see results in the first place. This habit doesn’t serve instant gratification but instead trains your brain to work continuously even though you don’t see results. And this is the base of any habit you want to build — Consistency. You become more inclined to stick to schedules and routines. Building the habit of regular exercise instils a sense of accomplishment and motivates you to form other healthy habits.\n"

In fact, before choosing to write, I tried a lot of different things that skipped my interest. I would never call the time I spend exploring a ‘waste of time’ because that is how I led to several skills that I have today.So, it’s okay to not choose a field and work on it even though you don’t enjoy it. Because this 1 hour is supposed to be enjoyable, and not increase your stress. This 1 hour is the time to invest in yourself — your interests. Before the new year starts, start some courses. Play around, and spend some days on a subject. Soon enough, you’ll find the thing you never get bored of.\n"

I have been waking up at 5:30 recently, and it’s transformed the way I think about mornings.I thought waking up early was the hardest part. But, not sleeping early is why you can’t make this a habit.So, if you ensure that you get 8 hours of sleep, and get enough sun exposure in the mornings immediately after waking up, it won’t be as hard.
